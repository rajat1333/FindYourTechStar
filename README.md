**Topic 1: FindYourTechStar**

Introduction: We as an individual struggle to find teammates for our project. For example, you’re a web developer and want to find a backend person to collaborate and vice-versa. It is difficult to find colleague even with popular sites around like: LinkedIn, HackerRank, etc.

Abstract: At the core, we will be providing a portal on the similar lines as of tinder but for techies only. On this portal the profile will be focused on technology (skills, tech stack, Github contribution graph, etc.). A registered user will create his/her profile which will be sort of a mini resume providing their professional details. The users will then fill their preferences that they are looking in a teammate such as: tech stack, skills, years of experience, etc.
We will be sorting and showing relevant and matching profile to a particular user's interests. Each user can then swipe the interested profile and only when both the users swipe each other they will be able to connect and chat.

We can integrate this portal with Leetcode, HackRank, GitHub for the users to check each other’s profile.

#Future Scope :
The application can work in two types of domains:
1. Technology Domains: Where techies can connect with each other if both users swipe each other's profile and get matched.
2. General Domains: We can extend this portal may be later to have other use cases as well apart from teammate finder for a project. Such as for finding roommates, hiking groups, etc. Here user will have ability to create a new domain to find people within that domain.

Approach:Webapp using React for frontend, node/java for backend.

Persona: Students, Teachers, Employers


**Topic 2:  Hotel Booking application**

Introduction: Implementing an end2end Hotel booking application for hotels with locations around the world (Web interface with supporting Backend APIs), that integrates Hotel rewards accounts with reservations for each Hotel customer.

Abstract: UI will be used by Customers and Hotel employees
input and output of API in JSON and including error handling and validation of inputs
APIs will support the following functionality:
Managing your Hotel rewards account
Searching for Hotels
Book one or more rooms for stay up to 1 week
Room rates  will be based on Room types and number of guests e.g. Double rooms, Suites, Single rooms ( up to guests)
Using dynamic pricing - based on weekdays/weekends/holidays
Seasonal - peak season such as Summer/Christmas Holiday season
Customer Loyalty
Changing/Canceling reservations
Enrolling as a new customer

Approach: We’ll use Java as the backend for our APIs and React for our frontend and will deploy the application on AWS.

Persona: Users, hotel employees


**Topic 3: A Forum Web Application**

Introduction: Developing a web application where users can discuss topics.( Like Stackoverflow or Reddit)

Abstract: As human beings, we are constantly evolving and learning new things. As we progress, every now and then we need help with things. This application will provide a platform for users to ask questions and get answers on various domains. Users will be able to register themselves via signup or other social applications like google. The application allows users social-media-like features through posts, comments, and reactions. This will be a more organized version of a social-media app where answer's can be found easily to users' questions.

Approach: The frontend of the app will be made using React and backend with Node Js. Databases like MongoDB can be used along with ORM. We will deploy the app on AWS or Heroku.

Persona: Users looking for discussion/ answers to their queries related to programming, coding, or any intellectual topic.
