Topic 1: Customizable Swiping software / AllPurposeSwipeConnector
Introduction: For new students of any particular university it is mandatory to connect with their colleagues for various purposes like finding roommates, finding project partners, finding a proper hiking group, and much more. We propose a generic swiping system same as tinder but which can be configured by an admin user to suit dynamic requirements for peculiar scenarios in an organization. Users can choose to connect with people for the various tasks as per their requirements

Abstract: At the core, we will be providing a generic platform that can be used to create multiple domains which can be used to connect people. We will be sorting and showing relevant and matching to a particular user's interests. Each domain will have different attribute values required to create its profile. These attributes will be configurable fields that will be used by admin users. 
The application can work in two types of domains : 
Generic Domains: Where people can meet other people if both users swipe each other's profile and get matched
Employer Domains: Employers will be admin users and will create domains and define attributes. All the users who are creating profiles will only be shown to employer users of the system. Here the match will occur between an employer user and an employee user.

Approach:Webapp using React for frontend, node/java for backend.

Persona: Students, Teachers, Employers

Topic 3: A Forum Web Application

Problem Statement: Developing a web application where users can discuss topics.( Like Stackoverflow or Reddit)
Abstract: As human beings, we are constantly evolving and learning new things. As we progress, every now and then we need help with things. This application will provide a platform for users to ask questions and get answers on various domains. Users will be able to register themselves via signup or other social applications like google. The application allows users social-media-like features through posts, comments, and reactions. This will be a more organized version of a social-media app where answer's can be found easily to users' questions.
Approach: The frontend of the app will be made using React and backend with Node Js. Databases like MongoDB can be used along with ORM. We will deploy the app on AWS or Heroku.
Persona: Users looking for discussion/ answers to their queries related to programming, coding, or any intellectual topic.
