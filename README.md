## Introduction

We as an individual struggle to find teammates for our project. For example, you’re a web developer and want to find a backend person to collaborate and vice-versa. It is difficult to find colleague even with popular sites around like: LinkedIn, HackerRank, etc.

## Abstract 

At the core, we will be providing a portal on the similar lines as of tinder but for techies only. On this portal the profile will be focused on technology (skills, tech stack, Github contribution graph, etc.). A registered user will create his/her profile which will be sort of a mini resume providing their professional details. The users will then fill their preferences that they are looking in a teammate such as: tech stack, skills, years of experience, etc.
We will be sorting and showing relevant and matching profile to a particular user's interests. Each user can then swipe the interested profile and only when both the users swipe each other they will be able to connect and chat.

We can integrate this portal with Leetcode, HackRank, GitHub for the users to check each other’s profile.

## Future Scope 
The application can work in two types of domains:
1. Technology Domains: Where techies can connect with each other if both users swipe each other's profile and get matched.
2. General Domains: We can extend this portal may be later to have other use cases as well apart from teammate finder for a project. Such as for finding roommates, hiking groups, etc. Here user will have ability to create a new domain to find people within that domain.
3. Another usecase could be of adding Company persona with Developer persona so that both can connect by showing interest in each other.

Approach:Webapp using React for frontend, node/java for backend and mongoDB database.

## Persona
Developer, Hiring Manager, Colleague
