                <p>We as an individual struggle to find teammates for our project. For example, you’re a web developer and want to find a backend person to collaborate and vice-versa. It is difficult to find colleague even with popular sites around like: LinkedIn, HackerRank, etc.</p>
                <p>That's where FindYourTechStar comes in. There really is something for everyone on TechStar. Trying to find some new friends? Say no more. New kid on campus and looking to make the most of your college experience? TechStar's got you covered. TechStar isn’t your average social site — It's everything that a developer looks for in a single place.</p>
